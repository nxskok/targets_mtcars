# targets_mtcars

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of targets_mtcars is to demonstrate the use of targets to do a small analysis and make a document.

Packages used here:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(flextable)
library(targets)
```


We use the `mtcars` data, summarized thus:

```{r}
tar_read(mtcars_summary) %>% 
  flextable()
```

and make a graph thus:

```{r}
tar_read(mtcars_plot)
```
